// pyramid/vocab_genesis.rs — Genesis vocabulary seed tables for Phase 6c-A.
//
// Hardcoded-vocabulary kill: the 11 AnnotationType variants, 4 NodeShape
// variants, and 11 role names (formerly split across `GENESIS_BINDINGS` +
// the cascade_handler per-slug seed) all live here as const tables.
// `vocab_entries::seed_genesis_vocabulary` iterates these on every
// `init_pyramid_db` and idempotently publishes each missing entry into
// `pyramid_config_contributions` as a `vocabulary_entry` subtype row.
//
// Per the architectural-lens principle (Wire's build pipeline is itself
// contributions — an agent should be able to improve the system), these
// seed tables are the ONLY place the genesis strings are hardcoded.
// Phase 6c-B / C / D flipped the consumers (AnnotationType enum, MCP/FE
// constants, NodeShape enum, role_binding::GENESIS_BINDINGS) to read from
// the contribution-driven registry that Phase 6c-A shipped.
//
// Shape notes:
//   - annotation types carry a `reactive` flag. `steel_man` + `red_team`
//     are `true` today — Phase 6c-B's `process_annotation_hook` emits
//     `annotation_reacted` observation events on any reactive type,
//     which Phase 7 will consume for chain dispatch. The four
//     "next-v5" reactive verbs (`hypothesis`, `gap`,
//     `purpose_declaration`, `purpose_shift`) are NOT in the genesis
//     tuple below — adding them is a vocab publish (contribution
//     write), not a code deploy, per the 6c-B flip.
//   - annotation types also carry a `creates_delta` flag (6c-B). True
//     for `correction` only in genesis; lifts the pre-v5 hardcoded
//     `AnnotationType::Correction => create_delta(...)` arm into vocab.
//   - role names carry `handler_chain_id` values. Phase 6c-D deleted the
//     parallel `GENESIS_BINDINGS` const in `role_binding.rs`; role-binding
//     seeding now reads this registry directly. `cascade_handler` is
//     included here too — `db::create_slug` still seeds it separately
//     per-slug because its default depends on fresh-vs-backfilled; the
//     vocab entry documents its canonical fresh-pyramid default
//     (judge-gated).
//   - node shapes have no `handler_chain_id` today (shapes don't
//     dispatch on their own — they govern how nodes render / what
//     payload a node carries).

// ── Annotation Types (16 genesis entries) ───────────────────────────
//
// Tuple shape: (name, description, handler_chain_id, reactive, creates_delta, include_in_cascade_prompt, event_type_on_emit)
//
// Phase 6c-B added `creates_delta` — before v5 `process_annotation_hook`
// had a hardcoded `AnnotationType::Correction => create_delta(...)` arm.
// That arm is now vocab-driven: the hook reads `creates_delta` from the
// vocab entry, so operators can publish a new annotation_type that also
// creates deltas (e.g. a future `counter_correction`) with a contribution
// write, no code deploy. Only `correction` carries `creates_delta = true`
// in genesis to preserve the pre-v5 behavior exactly.
//
// Phase 9c-2-2 added `include_in_cascade_prompt` — operational directives
// (gap, purpose_declaration, purpose_shift, debate_collapse) no longer
// pollute the ancestor re-distill LLM prompt's `cascade_annotations`
// section. Narrative-feedback types (observation, correction, question,
// friction, idea, era, transition, health_check, directory, steel_man,
// red_team, hypothesis) DO flow into the prompt — they ARE the content
// the LLM should consider when re-distilling. steel_man + red_team carry
// `true` despite also being handled by debate_steward because their
// CONTENT (the argument body) IS narrative and belongs in the prompt.
//
// Phase 9 close-2 added `event_type_on_emit` — lifts the pre-close-2
// hardcoded `emit_annotation_observation_events` branch
// (`correction → annotation_superseded`, else `annotation_written`)
// into vocab. Only `correction` carries
// `Some("annotation_superseded")` in genesis to preserve pre-close-2
// behavior. All other genesis types carry `None`, which
// `emit_annotation_observation_events` maps to the default
// `annotation_written` cascade event.
