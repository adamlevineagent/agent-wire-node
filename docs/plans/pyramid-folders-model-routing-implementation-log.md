# Pyramid Folders + Model Routing + Full-Pipeline Observability — Implementation Log

**Plan:** `docs/plans/pyramid-folders-model-routing-full-pipeline-observability.md`
**Handoff (original):** `docs/handoffs/handoff-2026-04-09-pyramid-folders-model-routing.md`
**Handoff (addendum 01):** `docs/handoffs/handoff-2026-04-09-pyramid-folders-model-routing-addendum-01.md`
**Friction log:** `docs/plans/pyramid-folders-model-routing-friction-log.md`

---

## Protocol

Per the original handoff's "Implementation log protocol" section, each phase/workstream appends an entry when it starts, fills it in during implementation, and marks it verified after the verifier + wanderer pass. Format:

```
## Phase N — <Name>

**Workstream:** <workstream-id or agent description>
**Started:** <date/time>
**Completed:** <date/time>
**Verified by:** <verifier>
**Wanderer result:** <wanderer-agent-id or "n/a">
**Status:** [in-progress | awaiting-verification | verified | needs-revision]

### Files touched
- `path/to/file.rs` — brief description

### Spec adherence
- ✅ <spec requirement> — implemented as specified
- ⚠️ <requirement> — implemented with minor variation: <describe>
- ❌ <requirement> — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED because <reason>

### Verification results
- <test name> — passed
- <user verification from Adam> — passed with note "<note>"

### Notes
Surprising findings, lessons, friction — and a pointer to the friction log if anything was logged there.
```

Keep the log append-only. Do NOT rewrite historical entries; add "Revision" sub-entries if a phase needs follow-up.

## Phase 0a — Commit clippy cleanup

**Workstream:** Adam (direct commit)
**Started:** 2026-04-09
**Completed:** 2026-04-09
**Verified by:** git log (commit `28fb3e5`)
**Wanderer result:** n/a
**Status:** verified

### Files touched
14 files — see commit `28fb3e5` (`chore: clippy cleanup pre-pyramid-folders-model-routing`). Matches the file list in the original handoff's Phase 0 section exactly.

### Spec adherence
- ✅ Clean working tree for subsequent phases — all clippy-cleaned files committed as a single `chore:` commit distinguishable from the plan's changes.

### Verification results
- `git log --oneline -5` shows `28fb3e5 chore: clippy cleanup pre-pyramid-folders-model-routing` as the most recent commit before `adc664b plan: ...` and `ce7b62b plan: pyramid folders addendum 01 — Pipeline B scope fix`.

### Notes
Phase 0a was routine housekeeping. The substance begins at Phase 0b (Pipeline B wiring) — see next entry.

---

## Phase 0b — Finish Pipeline B (wire fire_ingest_chain)

**Workstream:** implementer agent (general-purpose subagent)
**Workstream prompt:** `docs/plans/phase-0b-workstream-prompt.md` (identical bytes reused across implementer / verifier passes)
**Branch:** `phase-0b-pipeline-b-dispatch`
**Started:** 2026-04-09
**Implementer commit:** `81248ee phase-0b: wire fire_ingest_chain for Pipeline B dispatch`
**Status:** awaiting-verification (verifier pass pending)

### Protocol for this phase
1. Implementer agent: fresh execution of the workstream prompt, commits when done. ✅
2. Verifier agent: identical prompt, unwitting — arrives expecting to build, audits in place, fixes anything missed.
3. Wanderer agent: no punch list — "does Pipeline B actually dispatch chains on file drop, end-to-end?"
4. Conductor marks `verified` after all three pass.

### Files touched (implementer commit `81248ee`)
- `src-tauri/src/pyramid/dadbear_extend.rs` — +617 / −58 net. Signature changes on `start_dadbear_extend_loop`, `run_tick_for_config`, `dispatch_pending_ingests`, `trigger_for_slug` to thread `Arc<PyramidState>`. New `fire_ingest_chain` helper (lines 562-763). Dispatch loop rewritten for claim-once-fire-once shape. 5 new tests.
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` — 2 call sites updated at lines 3287 and 6638 to pass `pyramid_state.clone()` / `ps.clone()` into `start_dadbear_extend_loop`.
- `src-tauri/src/pyramid/routes.rs` — 1 call site updated at line 8142 for `trigger_for_slug(&state, &db_path, ...)`.

### Spec adherence (against addendum §Phase 0b)
- ✅ **1. Resolve active chain definition via chain registry** — handled by `run_build_from` → `chain_registry::get_assignment` → `default_chain_id` fallback internally. `fire_ingest_chain` does not call `chain_registry` directly (correctly delegated).
- ✅ **2. Construct call context with new source file(s) as ingest input** — chunks via `ingest::ingest_conversation` (per-file) before calling `run_build_from`. Correctly identified that non-question chains require `pyramid_chunks` to be populated per `chain_executor.rs:3804`.
- ✅ **3. Calls `build_runner::run_build_from`** — line 722 of `dadbear_extend.rs`. Not `invoke_chain` (which is a chain-internal primitive).
- ✅ **4. Captures the returned `build_id`** — destructured from `Result<(String, i32, Vec<StepActivity>)>` and returned on success.
- ✅ **5. Returns `anyhow::Error` on chain failure** — caller (`dispatch_pending_ingests`) translates to `mark_ingest_failed` + `IngestFailed` event emission per the existing code path.
- ✅ **6. Holds LockManager write locks correctly** — chunking uses a short-lived write lock scope (line 589) that is released BEFORE `run_build_from` is called (line 722). Deadlock risk avoided. Lock ordering documented in the `fire_ingest_chain` doc comment as load-bearing.

**Scope decision** (explicit per prompt): Option B chosen — conversation content type fully supported; code and document content types return an explicit `anyhow::bail!` pointing at Phase 17 for per-file code/doc ingest. Records for non-conversation content types are marked `failed` rather than silently succeeding. Rationale: per-file code/doc chunking primitives don't exist yet (`ingest_code`/`ingest_docs` are dir-level scanners that would re-scan and duplicate-append chunks). Phase 17 introduces folder ingestion and will add the per-file primitives. This is a deliberate, documented scope decision, not a deferral — non-conversation records in Pipeline B today will observably fail with a clear error message pointing at the tracking phase.

### Verification results (implementer pass)
- ✅ `cargo check` — clean, 4 pre-existing warnings, 0 new warnings in Phase 0b files
- ✅ `cargo build` (via check) — clean
- ✅ `cargo test --lib pyramid::dadbear_extend` — 10/10 tests passing:
  - 5 pre-existing tests (CRUD, scan-detect, ingest lifecycle, session timeout, session helpers) — still pass
  - 5 new Phase 0b tests:
    - `test_fire_ingest_chain_empty_source_paths` — error on empty paths
    - `test_fire_ingest_chain_code_scope_error` — Phase 0b scope bail for code
    - `test_fire_ingest_chain_document_scope_error` — Phase 0b scope bail for document
    - `test_fire_ingest_chain_unknown_content_type` — error on unknown type
    - `test_fire_ingest_chain_chunks_conversation_before_dispatch` — end-to-end conversation chunking verifies chunks land in `pyramid_chunks` before `run_build_from` is called (exercises the load-bearing invariant from `chain_executor.rs:3804`)
- 🕒 Real-file-drop integration verification — pending. See verification checklist below.

### Real-file-drop verification checklist (pending Adam's manual run or conductor dev-server run)

1. Start the app in dev mode (or use preview_start on a launch.json config once one exists).
2. Create or open a conversation pyramid with a watched source directory.
3. Ensure a DADBEAR config is active for that pyramid (post-build auto-create handles this).
4. Drop a new `.jsonl` file into the watched directory containing at least a few user/assistant message lines.
5. Within one `scan_interval_secs` (default ~10s):
   - Logs should show "DADBEAR scan detected changes" with `new=1`
   - Logs should show "DADBEAR: dispatching ingest chain for claimed batch" with `record_count=1`
   - Logs should show "fire_ingest_chain: chain build complete" with a REAL `build_id` (NOT the placeholder `dadbear-ingest-<slug>-<uuid>` format)
   - Logs should show "DADBEAR: ingest complete" with the same real `build_id`
   - The ingest record in `pyramid_ingest_records` should transition `pending` → `processing` → `complete` with the real `build_id`
6. Drill the pyramid — the new session's content should be visible.

### Notes
- The implementer correctly chose Option B for non-conversation content types and explicitly documented the decision.
- Lock ordering is handled correctly: chunking scope + `run_build_from` scope are disjoint, no deadlock risk.
- `ingest_conversation` re-chunks the whole file on re-dispatch (no per-file message offset tracking in the ingest record schema). The implementer left a clear note that this is correct-if-slow for Phase 0b and Phase 6's content-addressable cache will make re-chunk work cheap downstream.
- One minor naming callout — `ingest_continuation` exists in `ingest.rs` but it takes a `skip_messages` offset that Pipeline B can't supply, so using full `ingest_conversation` is the correct choice. This is noted inline in `fire_ingest_chain` and is not a defect.
- No friction log entries needed; nothing surprised the implementer at an architectural level.

### Verifier pass — 2026-04-09

**Workstream:** verifier agent (unwitting, fresh execution of the same phase-0b-workstream-prompt.md)
**Started:** 2026-04-09
**Completed:** 2026-04-09
**Status:** verifier-clean — no changes required

The verifier arrived expecting to build and instead found commit `81248ee` already on `phase-0b-pipeline-b-dispatch`. The verifier performed a full re-read of the phase 0b scope (required reading list in the workstream prompt, in full for `dadbear_extend.rs` and targeted for the rest) and audited the committed code against each of the six addendum §0b spec items plus the lock-ordering and channel-setup architectural constraints. No defects found.

**Re-verification against spec items 1-6:**
- ✅ **1. Chain resolution** — correctly delegated to `run_build_from` → `chain_registry::get_assignment` → `default_chain_id`. `fire_ingest_chain` does not call `chain_registry` itself, which is the right call.
- ✅ **2. Chunking before chain entry** — `ingest::ingest_conversation` chunks into `pyramid_chunks` under a short write-lock scope BEFORE `run_build_from` is invoked. Satisfies the `chain_executor.rs:3804` zero-chunks guard.
- ✅ **3. Canonical entry point** — `build_runner::run_build_from` at line 722 (not `chain_executor::invoke_chain`).
- ✅ **4. Real `build_id` returned** — destructured from `Ok((build_id, _failures, _step_activity))` and bubbled up to `dispatch_pending_ingests`.
- ✅ **5. Error translation to `mark_ingest_failed`/`IngestFailed`** — `dispatch_pending_ingests` matches on the `Result<String>` and marks failed records per the existing lifecycle.
- ✅ **6. Lock ordering** — chunking `_lock` scope is the `ContentType::Conversation` match arm body (lines 589-620); it drops when the arm exits. `run_build_from` (line 722) then takes its own write lock internally. The tokio `RwLock` non-reentrancy is respected.

**Architectural re-audit:**
- ✅ `state.with_build_reader()` used to isolate the build's reader from the shared CLI/frontend reader mutex (matches `main.rs:3566` canonical pattern).
- ✅ Writer drain task covers all six `WriteOp` variants (`SaveNode`, `SaveStep`, `UpdateParent`, `UpdateStats`, `UpdateFileHash`, `Flush`) — matches `main.rs:3585-3631` variant-by-variant.
- ✅ Progress channel is tee'd through `event_bus::tee_build_progress_to_bus` so Pipeline B builds surface in build viz alongside normal builds.
- ✅ Layer channel drained locally (Phase 13 will expand build viz; out of scope for 0b).
- ✅ Fresh `CancellationToken` per dispatch.
- ✅ Claim-once / fire-once dispatch shape in `dispatch_pending_ingests` (one `run_build_from` call per whole claimed batch, not N sequential builds).
- ✅ Short lock scopes for DB state transitions; no lock held across `run_build_from`.
- ✅ No `Arc<AtomicBool>` in-flight flag — correctly NOT pre-empting Phase 1's work.
- ✅ No new `TaggedKind` variants — uses existing `IngestStarted`/`IngestComplete`/`IngestFailed`.
- ✅ Scope boundary: conversation fully supported; code/document return an explicit scope-decision error pointing at Phase 17; Vine/Question return an "inappropriate for Pipeline B" error. All four branches exercised by tests.

**Call site re-verification:**
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs:3287` — post-build IPC handler passes `pyramid_state.clone()` as first arg. ✓
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs:6638` — app-launch deferred spawn passes `ps.clone()` as first arg. ✓
- `src-tauri/src/pyramid/routes.rs:8145` — POST trigger route passes `&state` as first arg to `trigger_for_slug`. ✓
- `run_tick_for_config` signature accepts `state: &Arc<PyramidState>` and passes it to `dispatch_pending_ingests`. ✓

**Verification results (verifier pass):**
- ✅ `cargo check` (from `src-tauri/`) — 3 pre-existing lib warnings in `publication.rs` (private type `LayerCollectResult`) + 1 bin warning in `main.rs:5226` (deprecated `tauri_plugin_shell::Shell::<R>::open`). ZERO new warnings in `dadbear_extend.rs`, `main.rs` Phase 0b diff, or `routes.rs` Phase 0b diff. ZERO warnings in any file touched by Phase 0b.
- ✅ `cargo build` (from `src-tauri/`) — clean, same warning set as `cargo check`.
- ✅ `cargo test --lib pyramid::dadbear_extend` — 10/10 tests passing in 5.30s:
  - `test_dadbear_config_crud` (pre-existing)
  - `test_scan_detect_creates_pending_records` (pre-existing)
  - `test_ingest_dispatch_lifecycle` (pre-existing)
  - `test_session_timeout_promotion` (pre-existing)
  - `test_session_helper_updates` (pre-existing)
  - `test_fire_ingest_chain_empty_source_paths` (Phase 0b)
  - `test_fire_ingest_chain_code_scope_error` (Phase 0b)
  - `test_fire_ingest_chain_document_scope_error` (Phase 0b)
  - `test_fire_ingest_chain_unknown_content_type` (Phase 0b)
  - `test_fire_ingest_chain_chunks_conversation_before_dispatch` (Phase 0b — exercises the load-bearing chain_executor.rs:3804 invariant)

**No verifier-pass commit created** — the implementer commit (`81248ee`) already matches spec. Creating an empty "verifier-was-here" commit would muddy the branch history without adding signal. Status updated to `verifier-clean` in this log entry instead.

The phase is ready for the wanderer pass ("does Pipeline B actually dispatch chains on file drop, end-to-end?" — no punch list, just fresh eyes tracing the execution). After that, Phase 1 (in-flight lock) becomes the next verifiable piece because `dispatch_pending_ingests` now holds the tick task long enough for re-entrancy to matter.

### Wanderer pass — 2026-04-10

**Workstream:** wanderer agent (no punch list, just "does Pipeline B actually dispatch chains when a file drops?")
**Started:** 2026-04-10
**Completed:** 2026-04-10
**Status:** **caught a blocking bug — committed fix**
**Wanderer commit:** `6012ffd phase-0b: wanderer fix — clear chunks before re-ingest in fire_ingest_chain`

**The catch:** Pipeline B was one `clear_chunks` call away from shipping. The implementer's `fire_ingest_chain` called `ingest::ingest_conversation` which always inserts chunks starting at `chunk_index = 0`. `pyramid_chunks` has `UNIQUE(slug, chunk_index)` (`db.rs:107`). On the SECOND dispatch for any slug that already had chunks from the initial wizard build or a prior Pipeline B dispatch, the chunking step would hit `UNIQUE constraint failed: pyramid_chunks.slug, pyramid_chunks.chunk_index`, the ingest record would be marked `failed`, and the chain would never fire. Pipeline B would dispatch successfully EXACTLY ONCE per slug and then break forever.

The punch-list verifier missed it because: (a) the six-spec punch list had no "idempotency under re-dispatch" check, (b) `test_fire_ingest_chain_chunks_conversation_before_dispatch` only calls `fire_ingest_chain` once, (c) the equivalent wizard path at `routes.rs:3431` does an explicit `db::clear_chunks` before re-ingesting for exactly this reason but that pattern wasn't mentioned in the phase-0b workstream prompt or the addendum.

**Wanderer fix:** added `db::clear_chunks(&conn, &slug_owned)?` inside the chunking `spawn_blocking` block, before the `for path_str in &paths_owned` loop (`dadbear_extend.rs:614`). Added regression test `test_fire_ingest_chain_second_dispatch_no_chunk_collision` that calls `fire_ingest_chain` twice in a row on the same slug+file and asserts the second call does not surface a UNIQUE constraint error. Test fails against the pre-fix code; passes post-fix.

**Verification after wanderer fix:**
- ✅ `cargo check` — clean, pre-existing warnings only
- ✅ `cargo test --lib pyramid::dadbear_extend` — **11/11 tests passing** (10 original + 1 new regression test for the chunk-collision case)

**End-to-end execution trace (post-fix, verified by the wanderer):**

1. File drop in a DADBEAR-watched directory → picked up by `run_tick_for_config` (`dadbear_extend.rs:165`) on the next 1-sec tick after `scan_interval_secs` elapses.
2. `ingest::scan_source_directory` + `ingest::detect_changes` → upserts `pyramid_ingest_records` row with `status='pending'`.
3. `dispatch_pending_ingests` claims pending rows under a SHORT `LockManager::write(slug)` scope, marks them `processing`, drops the lock, emits `IngestStarted` events.
4. `fire_ingest_chain` creates `build_state` via `with_build_reader`; acquires chunking lock; **clears existing chunks via `db::clear_chunks`**; calls `ingest::ingest_conversation` for each source path; drops the chunking lock.
5. `run_build_from` acquires its OWN `LockManager::write(slug)`, routes to the conversation dispatch branch at `build_runner.rs:269-310` which loads any stored `QuestionTree` or falls back to a hardcoded default apex question, then delegates to `run_decomposed_build`.
6. `run_decomposed_build` → characterizes, loads the `conversation-episodic` chain YAML from `state.chains_dir`, generates `build_id = "qb-<uuid>"`, saves `pyramid_builds` row, runs `chain_executor::execute_chain_from` (which spawns its own internal write drain — the one in `fire_ingest_chain` is dead code on this path; documented in friction log).
7. Chain executes — forward/reverse/combine L0 extract, l0_webbing, decompose, evidence_loop, process_gaps, l1_webbing, recursive_synthesis, l2_webbing. On re-dispatch with existing L0, `combine_l0` is gated off by `when: "$load_prior_state.l0_count == 0"` so nodes don't dup.
8. Build completes → returns `(build_id, failure_count, step_activity)`; `fire_ingest_chain` logs "chain build complete" and returns the real `qb-xxxx` build_id.
9. `dispatch_pending_ingests` takes another SHORT write lock, calls `mark_ingest_complete` with the real build_id; emits `IngestComplete` events per record.

**Non-blocking observations logged to the friction log:**

1. **Release-mode chain bootstrap gap** — `conversation-episodic` chain YAML is NOT in the embedded fallback list. If the app is ever shipped to a user whose filesystem doesn't have the source repo's `chains/` directory, conversation builds will fail with "chain not found". Pre-existing, not Phase 0b's fault, but important for any distribution milestone.
2. **DADBEAR config CHECK excludes `vine`** — `db.rs:1085` CHECK only allows `('code', 'conversation', 'document')` but `main.rs:3249` tries to save `content_type = 'vine'` for vine slugs. Fails the CHECK silently. Pre-existing latent bug; fix when Phase 17 needs vine folder ingestion.
3. **Multi-file batch chunk collision when `batch_size > 1`** — Phase 0b's `fire_ingest_chain` clears chunks ONCE before the for-loop. For `batch_size = 1` (default) this is correct; for `batch_size > 1` the second file in the loop collides with the first. Latent until a user manually sets `batch_size > 1`. Proper fix requires extending `ingest_conversation` to accept a chunk_offset parameter; deferred to Phase 17.
4. **`fire_ingest_chain` writer drain is dead code on conversation path** — the drain task mirrors the canonical legacy-path drain, but conversation builds go through `execute_chain_from` which spawns its own internal drain. ~50 lines of idle code; not a defect; cleanup candidate for a future refactoring phase.

### Phase 0b — verified

**Final status:** ✅ **verified**

All three passes clean:
- Implementer: `81248ee phase-0b: wire fire_ingest_chain for Pipeline B dispatch`
- Verifier: no changes needed; clean re-audit against spec + architectural constraints
- Wanderer: caught chunk-collision blocker, committed fix `6012ffd`, all 11 tests pass post-fix

Feature branch `phase-0b-pipeline-b-dispatch` is ready to push to origin. Proceeding to Phase 1 (DADBEAR in-flight lock).
